  - [ ] Verify fix resolves the issue
  - [ ] Check for any breaking changes in behavior
- [ ] **Module Compatibility**
  - [ ] Ensure module works with both old and new provider versions
  - [ ] Update minimum provider version requirements if needed
  - [ ] Validate all examples still work correctly

#### Code Changes Required
- [ ] **Configuration Updates**

  # Example of potential changes needed
  [CONFIGURATION_CHANGES]
  ```
- [ ] **Variable Updates**
  ```hcl
  # If variable validation or defaults need updates
  [VARIABLE_CHANGES]
  ```

  ```hcl
  # If outputs are affected by the fix
  [OUTPUT_CHANGES]
  ```

### Action Plan

#### Phase 1: Investigation
- [ ] **Reproduce Original Bug**
  - [ ] Create test case demonstrating the bug
  - [ ] Document exact conditions that trigger the issue
  - [ ] Verify impact on module functionality
- [ ] **Test Provider Fix**
  - [ ] Update test environment to fixed provider version
  - [ ] Confirm bug is resolved
  - [ ] Check for any behavioral changes

#### Phase 2: Module Updates
- [ ] **Code Changes**
  - [ ] Update configurations to leverage the fix
  - [ ] Remove any workarounds that are no longer needed
  - [ ] Update variable validation if applicable
  - [ ] Adjust outputs if behavior changed
- [ ] **Version Requirements**
  - [ ] Update minimum AWS provider version in `versions.tf`
  - [ ] Update README with new requirements
  - [ ] Check compatibility matrix

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**
  - [ ] Test all affected examples (review all 16 examples)
  - [ ] Run full test suite with backup API retry logic
  - [ ] Validate backward compatibility (if maintaining support for older versions)
  - [ ] Test edge cases that might be affected
- [ ] **Example Updates**
  - [ ] Update examples to use fixed behavior
  - [ ] Remove workaround code from examples
  - [ ] Add test case that would have failed before fix

#### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] **Update Documentation**
  - [ ] Document the fix in README
  - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with bug fix details
  - [ ] Update variable/output documentation if changed
  - [ ] Add any relevant usage notes

[REGRESSION_TEST]
```

#### Validation Commands
```bash
# Test with examples
cd examples/[affected-example]
terraform init -upgrade
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy

# Run specific tests with retry logic
cd test/
go test -v -timeout 45m -run TestTerraformBackup[AffectedFeature]

# Full test suite with extended timeout for backup operations
go test -v -timeout 60m ./...
```
